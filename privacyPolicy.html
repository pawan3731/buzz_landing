            <p><strong>Purpose of Collection</strong><br />
                We collect personal data exclusively for the purpose of facilitating event and place suggestions within
                the app and website. The collected information is utilized solely to customize the shared or available

                confidentiality and refrain from utilizing your data for advertising purposes within our platform.</p>
            <p><strong>Limited Data Collection</strong><br />
                We adhere to a policy of minimal data collection and only acquire information explicitly provided by
                users during account verification or when furnishing specific event details. This approach ensures that
                data is gathered with the user&#39;s explicit consent and for specific, well-defined purposes.</p>

                Users are required to explicitly opt-in to the data collection process, ensuring informed and voluntary
                consent. This opt-in process is specifically designed for account verification or to enhance the
                provision of more specific event information.</p>

            <p><strong>Data Protection</strong><br />
                We prioritize the security and protection of user data through robust security measures. Our commitment
                to safeguarding user information extends to refraining from any form of advertising within our platform,
                ensuring a focused and secure user experience.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Web Site Navigational Information Cookies, Web Beacons and IP Addresses</strong><br />
                BUUZ Software Inc. uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to
                collect information as you navigate the Company&rsquo;s Web sites (&ldquo;Web Site Navigational
                Information&rdquo;). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information used on the
                Company&rsquo;s Web sites and how this information may be used.</p>

            <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br />
                BUUZ Software Inc. uses cookies to make interactions with the Company&rsquo;s Web sites easy and
                meaningful. When you visit one of the Company&rsquo;s Web sites, BUUZ Software Inc&rsquo;s servers send
                a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize
                your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to BUUZ Software Inc., either by responding to
                a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a &ldquo;Contact Me&rdquo;),
                you remain anonymous to the Company. BUUZ Software Inc. uses cookies that are session-based and
                persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when
                you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer
                after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web
                browser&rsquo;s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company&rsquo;s Web sites,
                but you will not be able to successfully use the Services. The following sets out how BUUZ Software Inc.
                uses different categories of cookies and your options for managing cookies&rsquo; settings:Type of
                Cookies<br />
                Description<br />
                Managing Settings</p>

            <p><strong>Required Cookies</strong><br />
                Required cookies enable you to navigate the Company&rsquo;s Web sites and use its features, such as
                accessing secure areas of the Web sites and using<br />
                BUUZ Software Inc. Services. If you have chosen to identify yourself to BUUZ Software Inc., the Company
                uses cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time
                you log into the Services, a cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your
                account is placed on your browser. These cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are
                logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Because required cookies
                are essential to operate the Company&rsquo;s Web sites and the Services, there is no option to opt out
                of these cookies.</p>

            <p><strong>Performance Cookies</strong><br />
                These cookies collect information about how Visitors use our Web site, including which pages visitors go
                to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages. These cookies do not collect
                information that individually identifies a Visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated
                and anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Company&rsquo;s Web site functions and performs.</p>

            <p><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong><br />
                Functionality cookies allow the Company&rsquo;s Web sites to remember information you have entered or
                choices you make (such as your username, language, or your region) and provide enhanced, more personal
                features. These cookies also enable you to optimize your use of BUUZ Software&rsquo;s Services after
                logging in. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and
                other parts of web pages that you can customize.<br />
                <strong>Flash Cookies</strong><br />
                BUUZ Software Inc. uses local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or
                display content based upon what you view on our Web sites to personalize your visit. To learn how to opt
                out of functionality cookies using your browser settings send a request to&nbsp;<a

            <p><strong>Targeting or Advertising Cookies</strong><br />
                From time-to-time, BUUZ Software Inc. engages third parties to track and analyze usage and volume
                statistical information from individuals who visit the Company&rsquo;s Web sites. BUUZ Software Inc.
                sometimes uses cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of Company advertisements.
                For example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited the Company&rsquo;s Web sites. The
                information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be
                re-associated with personal information after the Company receives it. BUUZ Software Inc. also contracts
                with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from Web beacons
                (see below) on the Company&rsquo;s Web sites, from emails, and on third-party Web sites. Ad networks
                follow your online activities over time by collecting Web Site Navigational Information through
                automated means, including through the use of cookies. They use this information to provide
                advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests. You may see these advertisements
                on other Web sites. This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing
                efforts.</p>

            <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br />
                BUUZ Software Inc. uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about
                Customers and Visitors&rsquo; usage of the Company&rsquo;s Web sites and interaction with emails from
                the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on
                your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a
                description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, BUUZ Software Inc. may place Web beacons
                in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to
                one of the Company&rsquo;s Web sites. BUUZ Software Inc. uses Web beacons to operate and improve the
                Company&rsquo;s Web sites and email communications.
            </p>
            <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br />
                When you visit BUUZ Software&rsquo;s Web sites, the Company collects your Internet Protocol
                (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, BUUZ Software
                Inc. uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the
                Company&rsquo;s websites. BUUZ Software Inc. also collects IP addresses from Customers whey they log
                into the Services as part of the Company&rsquo;s &ldquo;Identity Confirmation&rdquo; and &ldquo;IP Range
                Restrictions&rdquo; security features.</p>

            <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong><br />
                Currently, various browsers &ndash; including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari &ndash; offer a
                &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; or &ldquo;DNT&rdquo; option that relies on a technology known as a DNT
                header, which sends a signal to Web sites&rsquo; visited by the user about the user&rsquo;s browser DNT
                preference setting. BUUZ Software Inc. does not currently commit to responding to browsers&rsquo; DNT
                signals with respect to the Company&rsquo;s Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for
                DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent
                standard of interpreting user intent. BUUZ Software Inc. takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously
                and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the
                implementation of a standard.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Protecting Information CollectedAffiliates &amp; Business Partners</strong><br />
                The Company underscores that it does not share any personal data, such as names, emails, or phone
                numbers, with affiliates or business partners. The sharing of Data About BUUZ Software Inc. Customers
                with other companies, including affiliates of the BUUZ Software Inc. corporate group, is limited and
                conducted solely for operational purposes, such as customer relationship management.Additionally, in
                instances where BUUZ Software Inc. collaborates with other companies to offer joint products or
                services, the Company wants to make it clear that it does not share personal information with these
                partners unless you expressly opt for a jointly-offered product or service. Your Data About BUUZ
                Software Inc. Customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest will not be
                shared with joint promotion partners unless you actively choose to participate. BUUZ Software Inc.
                emphasizes that your information remains private, and any sharing is contingent upon your explicit
                choice to engage in joint offerings.</p>

            <p><strong>Third Parties</strong><br />
                This Privacy Statement outlines the information BUUZ Software Inc. gathers on the Company&rsquo;s
                websites and emphasizes our commitment to never share your data with any third party. BUUZ Software Inc.
                does not authorize the collection of personal information by third parties through advertising
                technologies deployed on the Company&rsquo;s websites, and we do not disclose personal information
                collected from the Company&rsquo;s websites to any third parties, except as specified in this Privacy
                Statement. Section 4 of this Privacy Statement, Web Site Navigational Information, explicitly addresses
                the information we collect through cookies and web beacons, along with guidance on how you can manage
                cookies through your web browsers. Your data is of utmost importance to us, and we ensure it remains
                confidential.</p>
